<!-- # 🎥 SOL task 4c for Friday, 31 January 2020, 16:35

Due to a conference taking place at the same time as our lesson on Friday afternoon, please use those ~70 minutes to create a short (i.e. a few seconds) stop motion movie of the molecular processes involved in an action potential (cf. image 1 on page 13).

* You can work wherever and whenever you want, before Friday, 31 January 2020, 16:35
* Please upload your movie via the following link: [https://www.dropbox.com/request/vloR9xvsNa4GGmCT3ILb](https://www.dropbox.com/request/vloR9xvsNa4GGmCT3ILb)
* The quality (0 - 3 points) will count as a 10% bonus (i.e. not required for grade 6) for the test.
* The best way to do it is to use...
    * Modelling paste, paper, pens, etc.
    * The camera of your smartphone
    * The recording feature of powerpoint or keynote or a free stop motion app
